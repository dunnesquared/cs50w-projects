# CS50W Projects: Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

From January to June 2020 via the online educational platform, [edX](https://www.edx.org/), I was enrolled in Harvard University's [CS50W: Web Programming with Python and JavaScript](https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-web-programming-with-python-and-javascript). While I had done web programming in both languages before, this course helped me fill in gaps in my knowledge and toolset, especially concerning databases, Ajax and APIs. Projects for this course included building a


- Book-review website where registered users can find and write reviews, as well as view information from [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/) via its API.
- Slack-like chat application.
- Django-based app for handling pizza orders and accept credit-card payments using [Stripe's](https://www.stripe.com/) API.

You can also view my (somewhat awkward) [screencasts](https://vimeo.com/user107428552) of my submitted projects.

While I've no problem with current CS50W students taking a look at these projects, I obviously 
don't want my code to be copied and passed on as original work. Plagiarizing is bad for 
lots of reasons, but the one that should concern cheaters the most is that edX _will_ catch you. So, be
smart and do your own workðŸ˜†!
